# CS2250 Personal Site Course Project

**CS2250** (Introduction to Web Science and Technology) teaches the fundamental basics of the web: what it is, how it works, and how to build sites/apps for the web. Course material is taught and reinforced by building a personal website and a web app to deploy this website, introducing the field of the World Wide Web.

> This repository was created after completing sections covering HTML and CSS. Each section covered will be outlined below, along with the expectations and instructions of that section. The use of Git and Github is not covered in this course, but is used here for easy deployment.

## Markup

This section is the start of creating a personal website. The content has full creative freedom, but should have at least two pages and have each of the HTML elements listed on the assignment guidelines posted on Canvas at least once.

HTML syntax is validated with an online [HTML validator](http://validator.w3.org/).

## Styling

This section is the start of styling your personal website by using an external stylesheet named `style.css`. The stylesheet should have each of the properties and selectors listed on the assignment guidelines posted on Canvas at least once.

CSS syntax is validated with an online [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload).
